## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
dfinc <- readRDS("~/GitHub/MDTC_g9/Proj_1/incomplete_data_g9.rds")
dfcom <- readRDS("~/GitHub/MDTC_g9/Proj_1/complete_data.rds")
dfisNA <- dfinc
summary(dfinc)
```
```{r}
ini <- mice(dfinc, maxit = 0)
meth <- ini$method
meth["bmi"] <- "~ I(weight / (height * 100)^2)"
```


```{r}
imp1 <- mice(dfinc,
             m = 5,
             maxit = 20,
             method = meth,
             seed = 12345,
             print = FALSE)
```

## Evaluation
```{r}

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
